## Behind the scenes

A lot has been gong on behind the scenes and we are now able to start showing some of the results of these efforts.Both
myself and Lukas have been working with Dan on several initiatives to continue to bring the PSAppDeployToolkit forward.
(Lukas much longer than myself -- he has been very digilient with the forum and submitting many fixes for several
months.) Dan has also been busy with some more long term activities that we cannot share quite yet.

## The New Website

This new website is the culmination of discussions to up our game in terms of community involvement. This is the comes
in many forms but right now it means better communication to our dedicated users in terms of news, the reasons for
design choices and what goes into those decisions. It is difficult to fully explain in detail in changelogs and commits.
This blog will be **THE** source for upcoming changes, new versions and future design discussions.

## The New Logo

What goes better with a new website than a new logo? This time, it just happens to be a coincidence but it works. It does
however show our ongoing committment to keeping PSADT up to date and relevant. As an end-user facing (sometimes) tool,
it is important to look professional and polished to gain user acceptance.

## A New Era

While it was alluded to in the previous sections, we are committed to being more open and communicative in the future.
The website enables this by allowing us to have these blog posts and hopefully a better layout for more documentation.
As some have noticed, we have copied the Admin Guide to the
[GitHub wiki](https://github.com/PSAppDeployToolkit/PSAppDeployToolkit/wiki). We've also joined the
[WinAdmins](https://winadmins.io/) [Discord chat](https://aka.ms/WinAdmins) to be active in the discussions there. We
are looking forward to working with the community and getting more feedback in the future.
